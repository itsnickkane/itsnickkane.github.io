My dad once said to me:

> You are a flavor of the week type of guy...

Honestly this was a little bit hurtful. My therapist says its because I haven't found my "Passion" yet.

However, he was right, and instead of fight it, I figured I should embrace it. 

I like to say I am a polymath... or maybe I have ADHD.. I don't quite know. Rather then run from it lets embrace it. 

This blog is about what I am into each week, because typically my interests do change from week to week.
