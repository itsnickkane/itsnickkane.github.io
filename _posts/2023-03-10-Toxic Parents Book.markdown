I’ve been aware of the repeating destructive cycles in my life for some time. I seem to be repeating the same patterns in my romantic relationships and career. Although I am vaguely aware of what I am doing, even when it's happening I can see that I am doing the same thing I have done over and over again. Even with this recognition, there was a sense of hopelessness and inevitability. 

“This is what I do” “ I know this isn’t going to work out” “I shouldn’t be doing this” “why am I doing this”

However aware I was of what I was doing, I wasn’t doing anything about it. I knew what I was doing, but I didn’t know why. The best I could come up with was “I wasn’t happy”.

Which is funny because internally I would tell myself it wasn’t important to be happy. Life was not about being happy, that was a childish and immature aim. Life is about serving others, sacrifice, contributing, etc. 

What I was really doing was rationalizing my own unconscious belief that I didn’t deserve to be happy. I wasn’t worth it, what I wanted didn’t matter. It was more than that, to say, “what I wanted didn’t matter” would imply that I knew what I wanted. I was always too afraid and critical to even allow myself to want things. If I wanted to be rich, that wasn’t what you should want, that isn’t good. Maybe I should dedicate my life to spirituality and become a Priest, Monk, Yogi.. I can’t do that, that will disappoint my parents. What if I did this? I can’t do that. What if I do this, doing that won’t make me feel good about myself.. I can’t brag to other people that’s what I do. 

I was always so caught up in how I imagined others would think and feel about what I did with my life, primarily my parents,  that I never gave myself the option to truly consider what I wanted solely for internal reasons. I had no internal reasons, or esteem. My entire being was built around the hope of approval. Someone else to tell me I am good enough, capable, worthy.

Even as I am writing this I have to fight the urge to wonder if others will like this, what will they think. Will people think I’m great, hold me in esteem, will they love me? I hope they will think I am good and worthy. 

As I reflect now, it seems obvious that one of my issues was low self-esteem. I guess I didn’t really understand the concept of self esteem. Some people have an innate sense of worth? Just because you exist, you have worth?  This was something I had a hard time admitting even to myself, because saying I had low self esteem made me feel again there was something wrong with me, I couldn’t even get that right. 

As long as I can remember I’ve been plagued by a negative and highly self-critical internal voice. I wasn’t good enough, I wasn’t capable, I would screw it up. It was so debilitating that I stopped trying. If I tried, and truly revealed myself, I would be rejected, it wouldn’t be good enough. The irony however is my experiences in life have been almost the complete opposite. I have had success, I am capable, people do value me. However, these inputs had little impact. My self conception and self defeating beliefs kept perpetuating t

Whether adult children of toxic parents were beaten when little or left alone too much, sexually abused or treated like fools, overprotected or overburdened by guilt, they almost all suffer surprisingly similar symptoms: damaged self esteem, leading to self-destructive behavior. In one way or another, they almost all feel worthless, unlovable, and inadequate. These feelings stem, to a great degree, from the fact that children of toxic parents blame themselves for their parents’ abuse, sometimes consciously, sometimes not. It is easier for a defenseless, dependent child to feel guilty for having done something “bad” to deserve Daddy’s rage than it is for that child to accept the frightening fact that Daddy, the protector, can’t be trusted.
