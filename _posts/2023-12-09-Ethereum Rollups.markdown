## Arbitrum

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId1 %}

Ben provides a very balanced view of the market overall. He uses a logrithmic regression and other data modeling techniques. 

## Optimism

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId2 %}

The home of Ethereum news. Breaking lots of Alpha and covering all of the top narratives and innovations first. The place for legitimate projects to be interviewed and the place for scam projects to be exposed (SBF).

## Base

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId3 %}

Good at finding small cap alpha

## Polygon

{% include youtubePlayer.html id=page.youtubeId4 %}

Great Macro perspective from a world class global macro veteran.

## Mantle

## Avalanche
