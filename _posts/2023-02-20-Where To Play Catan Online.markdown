I've been living in Mexico for the past 5 months. I started in La Paz, met a girl, and followed her to Monterrey for the holidays. Around Christmas time we had some of her friends over to my Airbnb to hang out and play Catan. I belive this was the second time I had ever played Catan. A few years ago I played with my roomates, but it was my first time and the tutorial I received left a lot to be desired. All I remembered was ports are important. 

This time, still with little instruction, and even though we didn't finish the game, I had fun.

It was actually a lot of fun. Like most board gaems it requires atleast 4 players. I was chomping at the bit to play again, but its not always easy to organize a group of 3 other people for a game night. Especially if you are living in a foreign country...

So if I can't get my fix in person, what should I do? The internet!


## Where Can I Play Catan Online?

After a little bit of searching I came across [Colonist.io][colonist-io]

I like Colonist because they have both a mobile and web app and you can play against bots and people. One of the draw backs of playing Catan in real life is that the game takes forever! Literally it can take hours to complete a game. 

I typically play agains bots when I play on Colonist. I like this becasue I can rep games, and I can complete a game in 15-20 minutes, rather then 2ish hours.


## I am still a Newby...How can I learn to Play Catan Better?

I am a big fan of Youtube. I "Cut the Cord" years ago, and I primarily watch Youtube these days. So when I wanted to figure out how to play Catan better I went to Youtube first. After some searching I found a channel I really like, its this guy named [Dylighted][Dylighted-youtube] and I highly recommend his channel.

If you want to check out one of his videos I recommend this one:
