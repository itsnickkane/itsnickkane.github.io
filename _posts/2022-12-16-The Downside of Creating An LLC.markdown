It is nearly the end of 2022 and I have hopefully just completed the last step in dissolving the California Limited Liability Company (LLC) I established in 2015. In all honesty, the process was not that painful. However, when you combine ignorance, neglect, and unpaid taxes, it became an albatross that I am ready to be done with.
In 2015, I had dreams of starting the next billion dollar software unicorn. I had an idea for a real estate software start up that I imagined would become the new way in which residential real estate would be bought and sold around the world. Keep in mind, I am not a software developer, I had never built software, and wasn’t even that computer literate…
I got my real estate license when I was 19 years old and sold residential real estate to family and friends while I attended undergrad. After I graduated I moved to San Francisco and began selling software. At the time I was selling Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). ATS software is software to help with recruiting, either for agencies or companies doing in house hiring. To me it appeared that the recruiting process and the home buying process were very similar. A job is like a house, the hiring entity is like the seller and the purchaser is like the job seeker. With this insight, I thought I could build software that functioned similar to an ATS but for Real Estate and dis-intermediate the agent allowing buyers and sellers to connect directly via software.
It is probably worth diving into my mistakes and what I learned, but that is for another time. Ultimately, the start up was unsuccessful and I moved on in 2018. I moved on, notice I didn’t say, “successfully dissolved the legal entity”. I guess I should take a step back first. Around the same time that I decided to build said software, and start the business I thought it would be a good idea to set up a legal entity. Although, it is advised that you consult with an Attorney, CPA, etc., I went the DIY route. I visited the California Secretary of State website, did a little reading, downloaded the 1-page Articles of Organization, filled it out, mailed it in, and viola! I was in business. Well not quite business - I had theoretically shielded myself from personal liability, but I also signed myself up for an additional $800 minimum annual tax that was due to the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) each year.
